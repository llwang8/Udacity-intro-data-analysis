# Intro to Data Analysis

This course makes introduction to the world of data analysis. I learned how to go through the entire data analysis process, which includes:

- Posing a question
- Wrangling your data into a format you can use and fixing any problems with it
- Exploring the data, finding patterns in it, and building your intuition about it
- Drawing conclusions and/or making predictions
- Communicating your findings

I also learn how to use the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to write code that's cleaner, more concise, and runs faster.


## Project - Explore Titanic Data
